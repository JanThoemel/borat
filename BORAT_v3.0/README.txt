BORAT 3.0

This version of the code implements the 3D Eikonal solver for ray trajectory analysis in re-entry plasma. 

Borat_main_3D_ExoMars.m runs 3D analysis of the atmospheric entry of the Schiaparelli Exomars capsule. Input file can be given in form of Tecplot binary szplt file and/or .dat file. 

EikonalVsSnell_Exomars.m compares the two different raytracing algorithms in terms of performances with different step size of integration.
